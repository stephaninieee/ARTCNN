110-2 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
## Introduction 
Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are powerful deep learning models widely used for image recognition. In this project, we train a CNN model to identify the artist behind an artwork. By analyzing patterns, colors, and compositions, the model can distinguish artistic styles and uncover the unique signatures of different artists.
